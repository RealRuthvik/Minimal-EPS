# **AI Usage**

## **Summary**

The following resources were helpful in guiding me in the right direction for building the circuit. While I built the circuit manually, Gemini provided nudges along the way. The resulting circuit may not be 100% accurate, but it is functional and meets all the problem's requirements (I hope it does).

### **Prompts & Conversations**

Below is a list of prompts used during the development process. Prompts generated on terminal.

* **Initial Circuit Questions:**  
  * "Where is the PWL source?"  
  * "Help me fix the voltage controlled current source."  
  * "Is the battery in parallel or series with the current source?"  
* **Component Value Calculations:**  
  * "This is supposed to be a 7.4V battery. I don't have a battery component, so they told me to put two batteries back-to-back to simulate charging and discharging. What should the values be?"  
  * "The total power generated by the current source is supposed to be 6W and the battery after the payload has to be 7.4V. What should the values of other components be so that it meets the criteria of 6W and 7.4V?"
* ** pwl Value Calculations:**
  * How to use the pwl() function in circuitjs which the email's message attached image? I want to make a current source so that it provides current for 60 seconds, stops for 30 seconds and loops on and off.

  Useful response with errors: pwl(t % 90, 0, 1, 60, 1, 60.000000001, 0)
  Error recived: Parse error in expression: pwl(t % 90, 0, 1, 60, 1, 60.000000001, 0): expected , got %

  Got it fixed by using the floor() : pwl(t - 90*floor(t/90), 0, 1, 60, 1, 60.000000001, 0)
